# Countries of all the World

This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics using React and Redux. 
I selected an API that provides numeric data about countries then I built the webapp around it. The webapp has several pages:
- Home page with a list of countries that could be filtered by some parameters(Region, population...) and a random country at the top.
- The detail page for the country details; in the screenshot, the detail page for the Cook Islands country with its information(Capital,  Population, Currency, Region...).
